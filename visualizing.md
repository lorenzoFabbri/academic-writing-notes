## Basic Principles

- Tables and charts should provide information about **who, what, when, where**, including the units.
- Provide both risk difference (a-b) and risk ration (a/b), but also report the individual values (i.e., a and b).
- Report both the direction and size of the associations.
- When summarizing patterns, do not **cherry pick** the numbers nor report all of them in prose.
  - Follow the scheme: generalization (overall pattern) -> example -> exceptions.
- **Associations** can be due to causality, or confounding, or bias, or happenstance.
  - Follow the scheme: is the association causal or spurious? -> is the association statistically significant? -> is the association substantively significant (e.g., *clinically significant*)?
  - With a large enough sample size, even microscopic differences can be statistically significant.
  - One way to provide more information is to include **attributable risk calculations**.

## More Technical Principles

- Always specify the **units**.
