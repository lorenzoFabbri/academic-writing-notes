  - Understandable even without "A".
  - O: introduction of the larger problem.
  - C: framing of an interesting question.
  - A: description of the research plan.
  - R: description of how our understanding of the world has changed.
  - From OCAR to **IMRaD**: Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion.
    - I: Opening (first few dramatic paragraph(s) to introduce the larger problem that drives this research without explaining widely hold schema, context, and characters); Background (information to understand the work, why it's important, what will contribute to the larger problem); Challenge (description of the specific question(s) and hypothesis).
    - M (Materials and Methods): description of what was done in the work.
    - R: description of the findings.
    - D: development to the climax of the story, and the resolution that maps back to the Opening.
- **LDR**: Lead, Development, Resolution.
