# Academic Writing

## Stories

- **OCAR**: Opening, Challenge, Action, Resolution.
  - Simplest but slow to develop. Ideal for specialistic journals.
  - Understandable even without "A".
  - O: introduction of the larger problem.
    - If target is experts, open *quickly*. Opening that unfolds for a patient audience.
    - If target is broad audience (e.g., proposals), follow a 2-step opening: open with an engaging issue, then modulate it to one you want to work with. Can start with strong statement to take control of the story.
    - Set the O to draw in as broad a readership as possible. The *width* of the R should match that of the O.
  - C: framing of an interesting question.
    - Definition of a **specific question**.
    - The main body of the Introduction acts as the funnel of the hourglass, connecting O to C, expalining why this question is needed for the large problem (knowledge gap/background information).
    - Frame knowledge gap with SUCCESS formula, especially U and E.
    - Questions vs. hypotheses.
  - A: description of the research plan.
  - R: description of how our understanding of the world has changed.
  - From OCAR to **IMRaD**: Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion.
    - I: Opening (first few dramatic paragraph(s) to introduce the larger problem that drives this research without explaining widely hold schema, context, and characters); Background (information to understand the work, why it's important, what will contribute to the larger problem); Challenge (description of the specific question(s) and hypothesis).
      - Bad I: "little is known about this topic" -> some information -> "our objective was to...". Scientifically, logically, and linguistically inaccurate.
    - M (Materials and Methods): description of what was done in the work.
    - R: description of the findings.
    - D: development to the climax of the story, and the resolution that maps back to the Opening.
- **LDR**: Lead, Development, Resolution.
  - Ideal for generalist journals.
  - "L" combines "O" and "C".
